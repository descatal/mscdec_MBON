Can't fork 2 versions, so this is made

# mscdec

MSC bytecode to C Decompiler

**Note:** Not all assembly has an accurate representation in C. Attempting to decompile hand-written assembly (such as code modified with pymsc poorly) may not decompile.

### Usage

```
mscdec.py [-h] [-o FILENAME] file

"-h" : show help text
"-o [FILENAME]" : output file (default is the same as input file with extension changed to .c)
"file" : input file to decompile
```
